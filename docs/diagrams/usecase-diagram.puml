note right of Sensor
  IoT devices automatically
  send data every 5 minutes
  via MQTT protocol
end note

note right of UC7
  Uses Bi-LSTM with
  Attention mechanism
  for time series prediction
end note

note left of UC15
  Fallback mechanism when
  automated sensors are
  unavailable or faulty
end note
